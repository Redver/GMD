To make the roll a ball tutorial into more of a game I decided to turn it into a bit of a twin stick shooter style game, so I wanted to add shooting and multiple enemies to the game. 

Adding shots was fairly simple, duplicating the light box prefab and changing the size and colour then adding a tag called "shot" to make referencing it in code easier. Then I added the onAttack method, which gets the directional inputs from the arrowkeys as a vector2d, then converts to a 3d vector, which then spawns a box prefab with that vector applied, and launches it. Since now the player can launch physics objects at the enemy, I needed to make it maintain looking the cube at the player, and interact with the obstacles the player launches at it, so I gave it a rigidbody and moved the code from the empty parent to the cube shape. 

I added code to make the projectiles de-spawn after they hit the ground or hit the enemies, this is by using the collision trigger, and checking against the tag of what got collided with. If colliding on the floor the shot projectile will simply despawn, but if it hits the enemy, it triggers the enemy onHit() method, which decreases the enemy health by 1.  When the enemy is hit and their health reaches 0, they despawn. This means I needed a way to get more enemies into the game, to increase the challenge, so I started work on a spawner to continually make enemies until the end of the game. This works by assigning the player object to the enemy as a target in the start, so the newly spawned enemies can follow around the player.
