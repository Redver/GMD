In this set of time I added the main menu, options, extendable button logic and most importantly, Time Travel. The time travel is accessed through simply picking up a unit and moving it back along the timeline to a valid turn and valid province, then pressing the clock to send the unit back to that location, creating a new timeline. How this works required reworking a couple major parts of the game. Firstly is the fact that up until this point there wasn't really a proper game management script, with turns being handled by the selectors enabling and disabling one another, alongside the fact that ending turn required that turn to be loaded into the board, so ending your time must also end all your turns across the timelines. 

 Thus the gamestate, gameStateTable, and timeclocklogic were created to keep track of game states across both turns and timelines. The gamestate class was made up of data classes for the provinces, units and nations, to keep track of the parts which changed between timelines that needed to be saved, recorded and loaded again when loading that specific game state i.e the game at a specific turn in a timeline. In gameStateTable a dictionary is created with a set of helper methods to save and get gameStates at given turns and timelines. Next the timeclocklogic holds most of the logic for making, adding and loading states from the board, alongside clearing the current state to load the next one. A major overhaul was to the EndTurn calls, which originally went from the user input, to the player object, then to the nation as a unity event, and then from the nation as a unity event as well. The change to this was the fact that each board state and relevant gameobjects had to be loaded to have the end turns for that turn/timeline work properly (combat, province occupation logic, treasury calculations), but the  first endTurnAcrossAllTimeline methods didnt wait for the board to be both properly cleared and loaded, due to unity doing certain actions at the end of the frame. This meant that the endTurnAcrossAllTimeLines would have to go over multiple frames, leaving them the time for unity to load in and delete the gameobjects. This meant that the new end turn logic would go from input to player object, to the timeclocklogic, which would then reload the board over a couple frames to let the end turn happen for that players nation in every timeline.

Eventually this got the game into a working state. Now it is possible to send units across timelines and fight across Europe. I would have liked to work more on the visuals, UI and cleaning up the code, but it seems fairly stable.
