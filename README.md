WebGL Builds:
I have hosted 2 differant versions, 1 where both players must use a controller during the gameplay, and 1 where 1 player is on the keyboard and the other is on the controller. Due to some strange issue with controller support, all controllers must do some inputs while still on the main menu so they can be detected during the gameplay. Both main menus should be navigated by keyboard, and the keyboard controls are as follows:

W,A,S,D ,  move selector

F, open options menu

V, open build menu and select any buttons (for example the play game button on the main menu)

Z, Build Unit if menu open, Move unit if one is held

X, Pick up unit,

C, Cancel unit movement and return to province

**Be warned** 

The main menu music and sound effects are much louder than the ones in the game, and might feature some cannon fire immediatley into loading so be prepared
