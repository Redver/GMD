Working Title : Napoleonic War with 5 dimensions and time travel

A 2 player strategy game, with the ability to send units back in time, splitting timelines. Win by occupying the opponents capital and at least 75% of the map, summed across timelines.

Core Gameplay loops:

Primary: On a turn to turn basis, the player moves units and spends resources to start building them. The player starts and reinforces battles on their turns

Secondary: Over turns, the player stocks up on resources and captures territory, moving units to concentrate or disperse force

Tertiary: Over the course of a match, the player attempts to take over 75% of the maps territory, alongside the opponents capital

Objectives: Occupying and owning provinces is the objective, with the progression currently planned to be around the amassing and utilising provinces

Systems: The internal systems are mainly based around the economy - where provinces generate a given amount of resources to the owner per turn - which the player can then spend on building units. Units are moved by the player to different provinces to wrest control from them.

Time travel: The "twist" is the ability to use a units movement turn to send it back or across time, splitting timelines. In each turn where players time travel, if they travel to the same "past" then the timeline splits from that point. Players may send any amount of units back in time, and the unit maintenance cost is then paid by the timeline which sent it.
