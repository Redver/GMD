After refining a bit more of the turns and player systems, I began refactoring the selector class into an MVP architecture. This was due to the file becoming too long and unwieldly, along with doing too much logic in the area responsible for the UI. The Selector model contains data about which province is currently selected, and whether or not a unit is selected. The view gets the input from the user, and also pass along data gathered to the model through the presenter. 

Next I wanted to allow provinces to have the ability to have units built in them. To this end I created a little build menu ui, along with the script to control it. This was modelled as a state machine so that the animations toggle, between the states and that when the build is called both states can handle it correctly. This ui turns up next to the selector so there is only 1 gameobject that does the building shared across all provinces.

Afterwards I began working on how the units worked properly, creating a IUnit interface and a unit parent class then two implementations, boats and infantry, along with a unitView class that. I found this architecture to be the most pleasant one to work with as it gave me separation between UI, interface, common class and implementation. This helped with making the system for unit movement and the logic for changing province ownership at the end of each players turn.

When building in a province the units spread themselves out based on how many there are in the provinces unit stack.

When building units they are added to the stack, and when moving they are popped out if they are valid to move and are popped into the selectors unit stack. The infantry have 1 movement that is expended when dropped into a new tile, which also colours them grey. The boats have movement and i'll implement their movement methods later. In general units can only move into/through neigbouring provinces. This was using the findNeighbours method from the start of the project.
