In this update I refined how the controls work, along with  adding a unity event for ending turn that gets invoked to call other end turn methods across the game. I also decided to change how the selector works to just be a uniform acceleration mainly because of how difficult it became to select smaller and more complex shaped provinces, as this update was also where I added the remaining provinces and sea tiles. This allowed me to do some experimentation and testing to ensure UX was ok, and a main issue I found was that pressing an input for any amount of time resulted in repeating the action far more then intentional. Initially I solved this by creating cooldown subroutines but for better and more stable inputs I changed to instead use context.canceled in the inputs, so the input would be processed when the button is released.

Next due to how the provinces had been shaped I decided to change from box collider 2d to polygon collider 2d. My main concern and reason for wanting to avoid this initially had come from worries of performance issues, but after changing the provinces to polygon colliders it was clear that the performance had not suffered at all, getting a smooth 1900 fps on my desktop pc.

Along with making the rest of the sea tiles, I had added a method to provinces to find the number of tiles between themselves and another tile. This was an implementation of breadth first search adapted from a medium.com article. This allowed boats to work properly and go their full distance within one turn. 

This also allowed me to start working on the code to not let infantry units into water unless there is a boat present underneath the unit, and if the boat is destroyed then the units will also run a check to see if  they should be destroyed at the end of turn.

To add in some animations I decided to have the units explode into particles of a sprite upon "dying" in combat, changing depending on the nation. Naturally the British soldiers would explode into cups of tea and the French soldiers into baguettes. This was done by setting the death effect particle for the unit view in the init() function, depending on the nation, and then instantiating this effect when the unit gets destroyed.

To help keep track of the units a tresurey of the player I also started laying the groundwork for the remaining UI that the game needed to be really playable. For the Ui I simply hooked up some TextMeshPro text to the Nations that had the fields for the treasury, and also made some methods to count both all owned units and all units with movement remaining. Alongside these I also added some more PNGs to keep track of which numbers meant which.
